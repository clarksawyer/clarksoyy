Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

                        Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides.</p>

It was designed to provide additional features and capabilities while maintaining compatibility with C. C++ was created by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s and has since become a widely used language for developing a variety of software applications.

                        C++ is known for its efficiency, performance, and flexibility. It supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms, allowing developers to write code in a structured and modular manner. The language offers a rich set of features, including classes, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, exception handling, and operator overloading, among others.
                        
                        One of the key advantages of C++ is its ability to directly manipulate hardware and memory resources, making it suitable for systems programming and resource-constrained environments.</p>

                    <p style="background-color: rgb(212, 212, 91);"><b style="font-size: 30px;">JavaScript</b> is a popular programming language that is commonly used for web development. It is a versatile language that allows developers to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites.

                        Here are some key points about JavaScript:
                        
                        Client-side scripting: JavaScript is primarily executed on the client-side, meaning it runs in the web browser of the user. This enables developers to create interactive web pages by manipulating the HTML content, handling user events, and modifying the appearance and behavior of elements on the page.
                        
                        Object-oriented: JavaScript supports object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, allowing developers to create reusable and modular code. It provides features like classes, objects, and inheritance.
                        
                        Dynamic typing: JavaScript is dynamically typed, which means you don't need to specify the data type of a variable explicitly.</p>
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        </p>
                </div>

                    <p style="background-color: rgb(231, 148, 79);"><b style="font-size: 30px;">HTML</b> stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used for creating web pages and displaying content on the internet. HTML uses a set of tags to structure and format the content of a web page.

                        HTML documents consist of a hierarchy of elements, which are defined by tags. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< and >) and come in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag indicates the beginning of an element, while the closing tag indicates the end of the element. Elements can contain other elements, creating a nested structure.
                        
                        Here's a simple example of an HTML document structure: HTML elements can contain text, images, videos, links, tables, forms, and other types of content. They allow you to specify the structure of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and sections. By using HTML tags and attributes, you can format and style the content, define the page layout, and add interactivity through links and forms.</p>

                    <p style="background-color: skyblue;"><b style="font-size: 30px;">CSS</b> stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a programming language used for describing the presentation and visual appearance of a document written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). CSS allows web developers to define how the elements of a web page should be displayed, including layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects.

                        CSS works by specifying rules that are applied to elements in an HTML document. These rules define the styling properties for different elements or groups of elements. For example, you can use CSS to specify the font size, color, and background of a specific paragraph or to control the layout and positioning of different sections of a web page.
                        
                        CSS uses a selector syntax to target specific elements or groups of elements in an HTML document. Selectors can target elements by their tag name, class, ID, or other attributes, allowing fine-grained control over the styling.</p>
